    question: "Which part of the brain is primarily responsible for coordination and balance?",
    choices: ["Cerebrum", "Brainstem", "Cerebellum", "Thalamus"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The cerebellum integrates sensory input to fine-tune motor activity and maintain balance."
  },
  {
    question: "Damage to the spinal cord would most directly affect which function?",
    choices: ["Visual processing", "Voluntary movement", "Hormone secretion", "Language comprehension"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The spinal cord transmits motor signals from the brain to the body; damage impairs movement."
  },

  // ðŸ”„ Autonomic Nervous System
  {
    question: "Which division of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for 'rest and digest' functions?",
    choices: ["Sympathetic", "Parasympathetic", "Somatic", "Central"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The parasympathetic division promotes digestion, salivation, and relaxation."
  },
  {
    question: "Which neurotransmitter is released by preganglionic neurons in both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems?",
    choices: ["Dopamine", "Norepinephrine", "Acetylcholine", "Serotonin"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Acetylcholine is released by all preganglionic autonomic neurons."
  },
  {
    question: "The sympathetic nervous system originates from which spinal segments?",
    choices: ["Cervical", "Thoracolumbar", "Sacral", "Craniosacral"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Sympathetic fibers arise from thoracic and lumbar spinal segments (T1â€“L2)."
  },
  {
    question: "Which structure contains postganglionic sympathetic neurons?",
    choices: ["Dorsal root ganglion", "Sympathetic chain ganglia", "Cerebral cortex", "Vagus nerve"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Sympathetic chain ganglia house postganglionic sympathetic neurons."
  },
  {
    question: "Which cranial nerve carries parasympathetic fibers to thoracic and abdominal organs?",
    choices: ["CN III", "CN V", "CN VII", "CN X"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "The vagus nerve (CN X) provides parasympathetic innervation to most visceral organs."
  },
  {
    question: "Which effect is typically caused by sympathetic activation?",
    choices: ["Pupil constriction", "Decreased heart rate", "Bronchoconstriction", "Increased blood pressure"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and blood pressure, and dilates bronchi."
  },
  {
    question: "Parasympathetic stimulation of the eye causes:",
    choices: ["Pupil dilation", "Lens flattening", "Pupil constriction", "Increased intraocular pressure"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Parasympathetic input constricts the pupil and allows lens accommodation for near vision."
